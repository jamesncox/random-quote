Quotivational is a simple single page application I built with React. Featuring Redux for managing state and CSS media queries for responsive web design. 

Fetches to https://api.quotable.io/random random quote API.

Includes logic to display a random Albert Einstein image and quote whenever the app loads or a new quote is generated from the API.

Utilizes the Google responsive dev tools to determine breakpoints, creating responsive CSS media queries in order for all page elements respond to most devices.
